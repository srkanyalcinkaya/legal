## **3. Services Offered**  

### **3.1 Overview of LawLinkGlobal Services**  
LawLinkGlobal is a **blockchain-powered legal services platform** that facilitates secure and transparent interactions between users and **verified legal professionals** worldwide. The platform **is not a law firm** and does not provide legal advice. Instead, it serves as an intermediary, allowing users to:  

- **Connect with verified lawyers** for legal consultations.  
- **Schedule appointments** based on availability set by the lawyers.  
- **Communicate securely** through the platform’s encrypted chatbox.  
- **Conduct transactions using a blockchain-based escrow system** to ensure payment security.  

LawLinkGlobal operates on **Sui Network**, utilizing **smart contracts** to **automate transactions and ensure compliance with pre-determined conditions**.  

### **3.2 Platform’s Limited Role**  
LawLinkGlobal’s primary function is to provide a **digital environment** for lawyers and users to interact. However, users must acknowledge the following limitations:  

- **LawLinkGlobal is not a party to any legal relationship** formed between users and lawyers on the platform.  
- The platform does **not verify the accuracy, quality, or legality** of the advice given by lawyers. Users engage with lawyers **at their own risk**.  
- **No attorney-client relationship** is automatically established by using the platform. Users must independently verify any agreement they enter into with a lawyer.  
- LawLinkGlobal **does not store** chat conversations or user-generated legal documents.  

Users must exercise their **own judgment** when selecting a lawyer and proceeding with legal consultations.  

### **3.3 Wallet-Based Authentication & Access**  
LawLinkGlobal operates **exclusively through blockchain wallet authentication**. To use the platform, users must:  

- **Connect a Sui Network-compatible wallet** to access services.  
- **Verify ownership** of the wallet upon login.  
- Ensure they **maintain control of their wallet credentials**, as LawLinkGlobal does not store user passwords, recovery phrases, or other sensitive information.  

Since **users are not required to complete KYC verification**, their wallet address is the **sole identifier** for accessing the platform. **All transactions and engagements are linked to the user’s wallet** rather than a traditional account-based system.  

### **3.4 Escrow-Based Payment System**  
LawLinkGlobal integrates a **smart contract-powered escrow system** to **protect users and lawyers** during financial transactions. The escrow system functions as follows:  

1. **User books a consultation**:  
   - The user selects an available time slot from a lawyer’s calendar.  
   - The consultation fee is displayed in **SUI**, with a real-time **conversion to USDT** for clarity.  

2. **Payment is secured in escrow**:  
   - The user makes the payment, which is **locked in a smart contract escrow** until the consultation is completed.  
   - The lawyer **cannot access the funds until service fulfillment conditions are met**.  

3. **Consultation takes place**:  
   - At the scheduled time, the chatbox is activated, enabling secure lawyer-user communication.  
   - LawLinkGlobal **does not record or store messages** exchanged between parties.  

4. **Escrow release conditions**:  
   - If the consultation proceeds without disputes, **the funds are released to the lawyer automatically** at the end of the session.  
   - If the user reports an issue within the **designated dispute window**, the escrow remains locked until **LawLinkGlobal’s dispute resolution process** determines the outcome.  
   - If a refund is granted, the funds are **returned to the user’s wallet**.  

By using LawLinkGlobal, users **acknowledge and accept the escrow-based payment structure**, agreeing that **funds will only be released under the conditions outlined above**.  

### **3.5 Continuous Platform Enhancements**  
LawLinkGlobal is committed to **continuous innovation and service expansion**. While the **chatbox-based consultation system** is currently operational, the platform is developing **additional legal service features**, such as:  

- **DocPeers** – Blockchain-based secure document transfer.  
- **Solv** – Legal opinion and advisory smart contract service.  
- **Dispute Resolution System** – AI-assisted case assessment.  
- **Dava Funding** – Community-driven litigation support.  
- **Web3 Legal Integration** – DAO governance and DeFi legal solutions.  

Users should be aware that **new features may be introduced over time**, and **existing functionalities may be updated** to improve user experience and platform security.

### **4.1 No Attorney-Client Relationship**

- **LawLinkGlobal is not a law firm** and does not offer legal advice, representation, or case management.  
- **No fiduciary duty or privileged relationship** is created between LawLinkGlobal and any user.

### **4.3 Platform as a Neutral Facilitator**

While LawLinkGlobal provides **secure infrastructure** for lawyer-user interactions, users should be aware of **certain inherent risks**, including but not limited to:  

- **Jurisdictional Restrictions:** Laws vary by country, and advice given by a lawyer in one jurisdiction may not be valid in another.  
- **Misrepresentation or Fraud:** Although LawLinkGlobal verifies lawyers, the platform **cannot guarantee the quality** of service provided by any individual lawyer.  
- **Smart Contract Execution Risks:** Payments are managed through **smart contract-based escrow**, and once funds are released per platform conditions, they **cannot be reversed** without a valid dispute claim.  

By continuing to use the platform, users **accept these limitations** and agree to use LawLinkGlobal **at their own discretion and risk**.

- **Attempting to bypass LawLinkGlobal’s escrow payment system** by arranging payments outside the platform.  

Failure to comply with these standards **may result in immediate account suspension or permanent termination**.  

### **6.3 Security and Account Integrity**  
Since LawLinkGlobal operates on a **wallet-based authentication system**, users are solely responsible for:  

- **Safeguarding their private keys and wallet credentials**.  
- Ensuring they connect only through **trusted and secure devices**.  
- Not sharing their wallet access or credentials with **third parties**.  
- Monitoring their **transaction history** and promptly reporting any unauthorized activities.  

LawLinkGlobal **does not store passwords, private keys, or any user account details**. If a user loses access to their wallet, **the platform cannot restore access or recover funds**.  

### **6.4 Payment and Financial Responsibility**  
Users must **ensure they have sufficient funds** in their wallets before initiating transactions. By using LawLinkGlobal’s services, users agree that:  

- All payments **must be completed through the platform’s smart contract-based escrow system**.  
- Users **cannot request refunds** once escrow funds have been released, unless a valid dispute claim is filed within the designated timeframe.  
- Users **must comply with cancellation policies** to avoid unnecessary penalties.  

Any **attempt to circumvent LawLinkGlobal’s financial protocols** (such as direct off-platform payments) is a violation of these Terms and may result in account termination.  

### **6.5 Confidentiality and Data Protection**

- **Avoiding the disclosure of excessively personal, sensitive, or confidential information** unless absolutely necessary for the legal consultation.  
- Acknowledging that **LawLinkGlobal does not store chat logs or retain conversation history**.

---

## **7. Payment & Escrow System**  

### **7.1 Payment Methods and Supported Currencies**  
LawLinkGlobal facilitates all transactions exclusively through **cryptocurrency payments**, utilizing the **Sui Network** for secure, transparent, and automated financial processing. Payments on the platform are conducted using **SUI tokens**, with real-time conversion rates available for reference in **USDT**. Users are responsible for ensuring that their connected wallets contain sufficient funds before booking a legal consultation, as the platform does not support fiat currency transactions such as bank transfers or credit card payments.  

Once a user selects a consultation time and proceeds with payment, the full amount is **locked in escrow through a smart contract**, ensuring that the lawyer's fee is reserved while also protecting the user. The platform does not function as a financial intermediary but rather as a decentralized mechanism that safeguards transactions until service fulfillment conditions are met.  

### **7.2 Escrow System and Payment Processing**  
To maintain fairness and security in financial transactions, LawLinkGlobal employs an **automated escrow system** that ensures funds are held until a consultation is successfully completed. When a user books a session, the corresponding payment is immediately transferred to an escrow smart contract. These funds remain inaccessible to both the user and the lawyer until the consultation is finalized.  

Upon completion of the scheduled session, the escrow system triggers an **automatic release of funds to the lawyer**, finalizing the transaction. However, if an issue arises, users have a designated **dispute window** during which they may formally contest the consultation outcome. If a dispute is initiated within this period, the escrow funds remain frozen until LawLinkGlobal reviews the claim and reaches a resolution.  

Once the dispute window expires without any claims, the transaction is considered fully executed, and no refund or reversal can be requested. Since the platform operates on **blockchain-based smart contracts**, LawLinkGlobal itself cannot manually alter or reverse completed payments. Users acknowledge that their funds are subject to the conditions set forth in the escrow agreement, and they waive any claim against LawLinkGlobal regarding transaction finality once escrow releases the payment.  

### **7.3 Cancellation and Refund Policy**  
LawLinkGlobal permits users to cancel their scheduled consultations, but refund eligibility depends on the timing and circumstances of the cancellation. If a user cancels a booking well in advance of the scheduled consultation, they may receive a **partial or full refund**, with deductions applied as necessary to cover processing fees or cancellation penalties. However, if the cancellation occurs too close to the appointment time, the system may automatically impose a **non-refundable cancellation fee**, which is deducted from the escrowed funds before processing any refunds.  

Once a consultation has taken place, the payment is deemed **final and non-refundable**, unless a dispute is raised within the permitted timeframe. Users cannot request a refund solely based on dissatisfaction with the legal advice received, as LawLinkGlobal does not guarantee or oversee the quality of services provided by independent lawyers. Refunds are only granted in cases where the consultation did not occur due to technical issues, lawyer non-attendance, or other verifiable service disruptions.  

### **7.4 Dispute Resolution in Payment Transactions**  
In the event of a dispute concerning a payment or service outcome, LawLinkGlobal provides a structured **dispute resolution mechanism** to determine whether the escrowed funds should be released to the lawyer or refunded to the user. The dispute process begins when a user submits a complaint within the allotted **dispute window**, detailing the issue and providing any necessary supporting information.  

Once a dispute is lodged, the escrow funds remain locked while LawLinkGlobal conducts an internal assessment. The platform may request additional information from both the user and the lawyer to verify the legitimacy of the claim. If the dispute review determines that the user’s complaint is valid, the escrowed funds will be refunded to the user’s wallet. Conversely, if the complaint is deemed unsubstantiated, the payment will proceed as originally scheduled, and the lawyer will receive the released funds.  

All decisions reached through LawLinkGlobal’s dispute resolution process are considered **final and binding** within the scope of the platform. If either party remains dissatisfied with the outcome, they retain the right to seek alternative legal remedies outside LawLinkGlobal’s ecosystem, but the platform itself will not engage in further mediation beyond the internal review.  

### **7.5 Payment Security and Fraud Prevention**  
LawLinkGlobal upholds strict security protocols to safeguard user transactions against fraud, unauthorized access, and system abuse. All payments are executed **through blockchain-based smart contracts**, eliminating the risk of manual interference or financial manipulation. The platform does not store private wallet keys, transaction histories, or personal payment details, reinforcing the **privacy and decentralization** principles at the core of its design.  

Users are responsible for securing their own wallets and must take necessary precautions to prevent unauthorized access or misuse. If a user is found engaging in fraudulent activities, such as initiating chargeback fraud, manipulating escrow conditions, or attempting to bypass the platform’s payment system, their access to LawLinkGlobal may be **permanently revoked**, with legal action pursued if necessary. The platform maintains the right to **flag, suspend, or restrict wallets** associated with suspected fraudulent behavior to protect the integrity of the system.  

---

## **8. Termination of Service**  

### **8.1 Grounds for Termination**  
LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to suspend or terminate a user’s access to the platform under specific conditions, either temporarily or permanently. Termination may occur if a user is found to have violated the **Terms of Service**, engaged in fraudulent activities, or misused the platform in a manner that undermines its security, integrity, or operational efficiency. The following actions constitute grounds for termination:  

- Engaging in fraudulent behavior, including attempting to **circumvent the escrow system**, misrepresenting identity, or participating in **financial misconduct**.  
- Using LawLinkGlobal for **unlawful purposes**, including money laundering, solicitation of illegal services, or engaging in legal consultations that contravene applicable laws.  
- Harassing, threatening, or behaving unethically toward **lawyers, other users, or LawLinkGlobal staff**.  
- Attempting to **exploit, manipulate, or disrupt** the platform’s technical infrastructure, including smart contracts, blockchain transactions, or security measures.  
- Repeatedly initiating **bad faith disputes** or violating payment policies.  

A user’s access may also be terminated if they receive multiple verified complaints from legal professionals regarding misconduct, misuse of legal consultations, or breach of professional engagement terms.  

### **8.2 Process of Termination**  
If LawLinkGlobal determines that a user has engaged in activities warranting termination, the user will receive **a notification via their connected wallet address**, outlining the reason for the decision. The platform may, at its sole discretion, provide a warning before enforcing termination, allowing the user an opportunity to correct their behavior. However, in cases involving **severe violations**, LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to execute an **immediate and permanent suspension** without prior notice.  

Upon termination, the user’s access to the platform and its services will be revoked. Any pending transactions, including **escrow-held funds**, will be handled on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the nature of the violation and whether the user has outstanding obligations.  

### **8.3 Implications of Termination**  
Once an account is terminated, the user will no longer be able to access any of LawLinkGlobal’s services. Since the platform operates without **storing personal user data**, there will be no retention of account information following termination, ensuring compliance with LawLinkGlobal’s **privacy-first, decentralized structure**.  

If a user has ongoing financial transactions at the time of termination, such as **funds locked in escrow**, the status of those payments will be assessed based on the applicable **payment and dispute resolution policies**. If a terminated user is found to have engaged in fraudulent financial activities, any escrowed funds may be withheld or redirected in accordance with platform policies.  

### **8.4 Appeals and Reinstatement**  
Users who believe their access was **wrongfully terminated** may submit an appeal through LawLinkGlobal’s **support system**, providing evidence to contest the decision. The platform will review the appeal, taking into account any mitigating factors, and determine whether reinstatement is warranted. However, LawLinkGlobal maintains full discretion in deciding whether a terminated account may be reinstated, and its decision on such matters is **final and binding**.  

#### **8.5 Wallet-Based System and Account Security**  
Users must acknowledge that LawLinkGlobal is a **wallet-based platform** and does not rely on traditional account-based authentication methods. As such, maintaining control over one’s **wallet credentials** is the sole responsibility of the user. If a wallet is compromised, lost, or becomes inaccessible, the platform **cannot recover or restore access**, and the user will be unable to retrieve any associated privileges.  

Users must also recognize that **LawLinkGlobal does not provide refunds or compensation** for lost access due to wallet mismanagement or termination resulting from **breach of these Terms of Service**. Once a user’s wallet is suspended or blacklisted from the platform, they will be unable to reconnect using the same wallet credentials.  

---

## **9. Data Protection & Privacy**  

### **9.1 No Personal Data Collection**  
LawLinkGlobal is designed to operate with **minimal data interaction** to ensure user privacy. The platform does **not collect, store, or process personal user data**. All interactions are based on **wallet authentication**, and no traditional account registration involving personal details is required.  

Since LawLinkGlobal does not implement KYC verification for users, access to the platform is granted solely through a **connected blockchain wallet**. The platform does not track or retain personal identities, addresses, or sensitive data linked to users.  

### **9.2 Privacy in Communication**  
All communications between users and lawyers take place in a **secure, encrypted chat environment**. To maintain confidentiality:  

- Chat **messages are not stored** on the platform after a consultation ends.  
- LawLinkGlobal does not retain logs, conversation history, or consultation records.  
- Users are responsible for protecting any information they choose to share during their interactions.  

While the platform ensures **end-to-end encryption**, users must exercise caution when discussing sensitive legal matters. Any materials, documents, or evidence shared during a consultation should be done at the user’s discretion.  

### **9.3 Blockchain-Based Privacy & Security**  
Transactions and interactions within LawLinkGlobal are **secured through blockchain technology**, ensuring transparency and immutability. However, users must recognize that:  

- **All payments and escrow transactions are recorded on the blockchain**, making them publicly verifiable but pseudonymous.  
- LawLinkGlobal does **not store private wallet keys or manage user funds**.  
- Users are responsible for **securing their own wallets**, as loss of access to a wallet means irreversible loss of access to the platform.  

### **9.4 Third-Party Data Access**  
LawLinkGlobal does not sell, share, or distribute user data to third parties. The platform does not engage in **advertising, data tracking, or behavioral profiling**. However, users should be aware that:  

- Transactions made on a **public blockchain** are inherently traceable within the blockchain ledger.  
- Any **third-party services** users choose to interact with (such as external wallet providers) may have their own data policies beyond LawLinkGlobal’s control.  

### **9.5 Security Responsibilities of Users**  
Users must take personal responsibility for safeguarding their information by:  

- **Keeping wallet credentials private** and secure.  
- Avoiding phishing scams, fraudulent links, or unauthorized third-party access.  
- **Verifying lawyers independently** if sharing sensitive legal documents.  

LawLinkGlobal provides the **infrastructure for secure interactions** but does not intervene in user communications, store consultation records, or recover lost credentials.

### **10.3 User-Generated Content**  
Any content shared by users during consultations, including legal documents or messages, remains the property of the user. LawLinkGlobal does not claim ownership over any user-generated content, nor does it store or retain such materials after consultations conclude.  

### **10.4 Reporting Intellectual Property Violations**  
If a user believes that their intellectual property rights have been violated through unauthorized use of content on the platform, they may submit a complaint to LawLinkGlobal’s support team. The platform will review such claims and take appropriate action where necessary, including removing infringing content or restricting access to users who violate intellectual property laws.

## **11. Dispute Resolution**  

### **11.1 Handling of Disputes**  
Disputes arising from consultations, payments, or platform use should first be resolved between the involved parties. Users are encouraged to communicate directly with lawyers to address concerns before escalating a dispute through LawLinkGlobal. If a resolution cannot be reached, LawLinkGlobal provides a structured dispute resolution process for escrow-related issues.  

### **11.2 Filing a Dispute**  
A dispute must be formally submitted within the designated timeframe after a consultation. The user or lawyer initiating the dispute must provide relevant details explaining the issue. Once a dispute is filed, the escrowed funds remain locked until a resolution is determined.  

### **11.3 Dispute Resolution Process**  
LawLinkGlobal will review the submitted dispute, considering available transaction data, user reports, and any relevant communication. Additional information may be requested from both parties. If the dispute involves a payment or service issue, the platform will assess compliance with its policies and determine whether funds should be released or refunded.  

### **11.4 Final Decision and Further Action**  
Once a decision is made, the funds will either be transferred to the lawyer or refunded to the user, depending on the case outcome. This decision is final within the platform’s scope. Users who wish to pursue further legal action may do so independently, as LawLinkGlobal does not participate in legal proceedings beyond its internal dispute process.
