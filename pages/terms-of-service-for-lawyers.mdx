### **2.2 User**  
Any **individual, business, or entity** that connects to the LawLinkGlobal platform via a **Sui-compatible crypto wallet** to seek **legal advice or consultation services**.

### **2.4 Escrow System**  
A **smart contract-based fund management mechanism** that ensures **fair and secure transactions** between Users and Lawyers. When a User books a consultation, the payment is **automatically locked in an escrow smart contract** until the session is completed.

### **2.6 Wallet Authentication**  
A **Sui-compatible cryptocurrency wallet-based authentication system** that serves as the primary **identity and access mechanism** for both Users and Lawyers.

### **2.7 Consultation**  
A structured **digital legal session** between a **registered Lawyer** and a **User**, conducted via the **LawLinkGlobal chatbox**.

### **2.8 Scheduled Appointment**  
A **pre-booked consultation session** between a Lawyer and a User. Lawyers determine their **availability and hourly rates** in advance.

### **2.9 Cryptocurrency Payments**  
All transactions on the LawLinkGlobal platform are conducted **exclusively in SUI tokens** or other supported cryptocurrencies. Payments are processed via **smart contracts**, ensuring **automatic escrow protection, transparency, and instant settlement** once consultations are completed.

## **4. Document Verification**  

### **4.1 Importance of Authentic Documentation**  

Ensuring the integrity of the legal professionals on the platform is a fundamental principle of LawLinkGlobal. The platform is committed to maintaining a **secure, trustworthy, and transparent environment** where users can confidently engage with licensed lawyers. To uphold these standards, every lawyer who wishes to offer legal services on LawLinkGlobal must undergo a **document verification process**.  

The verification process serves several key purposes:  

- **Authentication of Legal Professionals:** Only verified lawyers can provide legal consultation services, preventing unauthorized or unqualified individuals from misleading users.  
- **Protection of Users:** Verified legal credentials ensure that users receive professional and competent legal advice.  
- **Compliance with Global Legal Standards:** By verifying lawyers’ credentials, LawLinkGlobal aligns with international best practices for legal service platforms.

Failure to submit **genuine, accurate, and up-to-date** documents may result in the suspension or **permanent removal** of a lawyer’s account. Any attempts to manipulate or falsify verification documents will be treated as a **serious violation** of the platform’s policies and may result in **legal consequences**.  

### **4.2 Verification Process**  

To gain access to the full range of features and offer legal consultations, lawyers must complete the following **verification steps**:  

#### **Submission of Required Documents**  

Lawyers must provide **encrypted digital copies** of their **official legal credentials**, including:  

1. **Proof of Bar Membership** – An official certificate or document confirming that the lawyer is registered with the relevant bar association and authorized to practice law in their jurisdiction.  
2. **Law Degree or Equivalent Qualification** – A valid academic credential proving that the lawyer has completed the necessary legal education.

All submitted documents are **encrypted** before being transmitted to the LawLinkGlobal **admin verification panel**. Lawyers must ensure that their submissions are clear, legible, and in the correct format as specified by the platform.  

Once received, the **admin panel reviews and verifies** the credentials before deciding whether to approve or reject the lawyer’s registration.  

#### **Whitelisting Upon Approval**  

If a lawyer successfully passes the verification process, their **wallet address is whitelisted** on the platform. This **whitelisting serves as the primary identifier** of the lawyer’s verified status, allowing them to:  

- Offer **legal consultations** on the platform.  
- Set their **availability and fee structure**.  
- Receive **payments through escrow smart contracts**.  

### **4.3 Consequences of False Documentation**

## **5. Fee Structure and Payments**  

### **5.1 Platform Payment Mechanism**  

LawLinkGlobal operates on a **blockchain-based financial system**, ensuring a **secure, transparent, and automated** transaction process for all legal consultations. Payments are processed exclusively through **Sui Network smart contracts**, eliminating the need for traditional financial intermediaries.  

When a User books a consultation with a Lawyer, the corresponding fee is **automatically locked in an escrow smart contract**. The escrow mechanism ensures that the payment is securely held until the consultation is successfully completed, after which the funds are released to the Lawyer’s wallet. If a dispute arises, the payment remains in escrow until **LawLinkGlobal’s dispute resolution process is finalized**.  

All transactions on the platform are conducted in **SUI tokens**, which serve as the **primary currency for payments**. The system provides **real-time USDT conversion** to allow Lawyers to determine their rates with reference to a stable value, but all transactions remain settled in **SUI tokens**.  

Lawyers acknowledge and accept that the platform **does not support fiat currency transactions** and that the value of **cryptocurrency payments may be subject to market fluctuations**. By participating in the platform, Lawyers assume full responsibility for any volatility-related risks associated with receiving payments in SUI tokens.  

### **5.2 Setting Consultation Fees**  

Each Lawyer retains full **autonomy** in setting their own consultation fees, allowing them to establish rates that reflect their **expertise, jurisdiction, and level of service**. Fees are determined in **SUI tokens**, with an automatically calculated **USDT equivalent** displayed for User reference.  

To ensure clarity and consistency in payment expectations, Lawyers must:  

- Set a **fixed hourly rate**, which will apply to all **standard one-hour consultation sessions**.  
- Regularly review and adjust their rates based on **market conditions and personal valuation of services**.  
- Be aware that once a User books a session at a stated rate, the **fee is locked in escrow** at the agreed-upon amount. Fee changes **do not retroactively apply to booked sessions**.  

LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to impose **reasonable limits** on the minimum and maximum consultation fees to ensure fairness within the platform. These limits may be adjusted over time based on platform-wide economic conditions.  

### **5.3 Receiving Payments**  

Once a consultation session has been successfully completed, the funds held in escrow are **automatically transferred** to the Lawyer’s wallet. The **release of funds follows a structured process** to ensure fairness and dispute prevention:  

1. Upon completion of a consultation, the **User has a limited time window to raise any disputes** related to service quality or misconduct.  
2. If no dispute is raised, the **escrow smart contract automatically releases the payment** to the Lawyer’s designated wallet address.  
3. If a dispute is raised, the funds remain in escrow until **LawLinkGlobal’s admin panel** conducts an investigation and issues a final decision.  

Lawyers must ensure that their **wallets remain active and operational** to receive payments. LawLinkGlobal is **not responsible** for any failed transactions resulting from **wallet connectivity issues, private key mismanagement, or external wallet provider limitations**.  

Additionally, Lawyers are advised to monitor **gas fees and blockchain transaction costs** associated with transferring SUI tokens, as these fees may vary based on network congestion and are **not covered by LawLinkGlobal**.  

### **5.4 Fee Structure and Payment Agreement**  

By offering services through the LawLinkGlobal platform, Lawyers agree to **comply with the platform’s financial policies**, including:  

- The **binding nature of smart contract-based escrow payments**, meaning that once a User books a session, the payment process **cannot be manually altered or reversed** outside of the **dispute resolution process**.  
- The requirement that all payments **must be processed within the LawLinkGlobal ecosystem**; any attempt to **circumvent the platform’s payment system** by arranging external payments or soliciting off-platform transactions is strictly prohibited and may result in **account suspension or termination**.  
- The understanding that **LawLinkGlobal does not offer refunds to Lawyers** for transactions that were **validly completed**, nor does it assume liability for fluctuations in the market value of SUI tokens.  

Lawyers are encouraged to review and fully understand the **Fee Structure and Payment Agreement**, which provides a detailed breakdown of:  

- The technical aspects of escrow-based payments.  
- The procedure for handling payment disputes.  
- The applicable fees and deductions for service usage.  

Failure to comply with the **Fee Structure and Payment Agreement** may result in **restricted account privileges, delays in payment processing, or removal from the platform**.

### **7.1 Duty of Confidentiality**  

All information exchanged between a Lawyer and a User during a legal consultation is strictly confidential.

### **7.2 National and Local Regulations**
