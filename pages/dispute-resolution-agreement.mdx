## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 Purpose of the Agreement

This Dispute Resolution Agreement (the "Agreement") establishes the procedures and mechanisms for resolving disputes arising from interactions on the LawLinkGlobal platform. LawLinkGlobal operates as a blockchain-based decentralized legal service facilitator on the Sui Network, where users and lawyers engage through a secure, wallet-based authentication system.
Given the nature of decentralized operations, this Agreement provides a structured dispute resolution framework to address concerns related to consultations, escrow payments, technical issues, and other platform functionalities. The goal is to ensure fairness, transparency, and efficiency in resolving disputes while maintaining the integrity of blockchain-based legal services.
Users and lawyers engaging with the platform must carefully review this Agreement to understand their rights and obligations concerning dispute resolution. This Agreement is an essential part of the broader Terms of Use and should be read in conjunction with other relevant policies governing the platform.

### 1.2 LawLinkGlobal’s Role as a Blockchain-Based Facilitator

LawLinkGlobal is a non-custodial, decentralized platform that connects users with registered lawyers for legal consultations. It is critical to understand that:

    - LawLinkGlobal does not provide legal services.
    - LawLinkGlobal does not act as a legal advisor.
    - LawLinkGlobal does not engage in legal representation.

Instead, LawLinkGlobal provides a secure and efficient environment where lawyers and users can interact via smart contract-governed consultations. The platform’s role is strictly that of a facilitator—it does not interfere with the substance of legal advice provided nor does it assess the accuracy or validity of legal guidance offered.

Dispute resolution mechanisms outlined in this Agreement only apply to issues directly related to platform operations—such as consultation scheduling, escrow transactions, wallet authentication issues, or procedural concerns. Any disputes concerning the quality, validity, or relevance of legal advice must be addressed directly between the lawyer and the user, independent of LawLinkGlobal.

## 2. Definitions
In this Agreement, unless the context otherwise requires, the following terms shall have the respective meanings as set forth below:

### 2.1 Consultation
A structured interaction facilitated by the LawLinkGlobal platform, where a user seeks legal advice or information from a registered lawyer. Consultations:
    - Occur exclusively through the platform's chatbox—voice or video calls are not supported.
    - Are conducted on a wallet-authenticated basis, ensuring both user and lawyer legitimacy.
    - Are limited to a maximum of one hour, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon.
    - Are secured through smart contracts, enabling automated escrow payments and dispute triggers.

### 2.2 Lawyer
An individual registered on the LawLinkGlobal platform who:
    - Holds valid legal credentials and professional qualifications to practice law within their respective jurisdiction.
    - Has completed KYC verification by submitting encrypted proof of legal credentials (e.g., law degree and bar registration).
    - Has been whitelisted by LawLinkGlobal’s admin wallet, thereby gaining access to the Lawyer Dashboard for providing legal services.
    - Can, in addition to offering legal services, use the platform as a user to seek legal advice from other lawyers.

### 2.3 User
An individual or entity that accesses the LawLinkGlobal platform to seek legal advice or information from a registered lawyer. Users:
    - Do not undergo KYC verification but authenticate via wallet connection (no email or personal details required).
    - Can schedule consultations and make escrow payments via the platform.
    - Must adhere to platform rules and engage in consultations in good faith.

### 2.4 Dispute
Any disagreement, issue, or conflict arising between a lawyer and a user, directly or indirectly related to:

    - Consultation scheduling, cancellations, or rescheduling issues.
    - Escrow payment release or refund claims.
    - Technical malfunctions or system failures affecting platform operations.
    - Misconduct or breach of platform rules by either party.
⚠️ Explicit Exclusion:
Disputes concerning the accuracy, relevance, or validity of legal advice are not covered under this Agreement. LawLinkGlobal does not interfere in lawyer-user interactions beyond technical, financial, and procedural matters.

### 2.5 Session
A scheduled consultation between a lawyer and a user, governed by escrow-protected transactions on the Sui Network. Sessions:
    - Take place in the LawLinkGlobal chatbox.
    - Are time-bound (default: 60 minutes, extendable by mutual agreement).
    - Trigger automated escrow payment actions based on chatbox milestones.

### 2.6 Platform
Refers to LawLinkGlobal’s digital infrastructure, built on the Sui Network, facilitating:
    - Blockchain-secured lawyer-user interactions.
    - Wallet-based authentication for identity verification.
    - Escrow-protected smart contract payments.
    - Encrypted data handling, ensuring that no personal user data is stored permanently.

### 2.7 Scheduled Time
The pre-determined date and time at which a lawyer and user agree to hold a session on the platform. The scheduled time is:
    - Immutable once confirmed, unless mutually rescheduled before the session starts.
    - Tied to the escrow system, meaning payments are locked unless a valid dispute is raised.

### 2.8 Wallet-Based Authentication
A decentralized identity verification mechanism where:
    - Users connect their crypto wallet (SUI-supported wallets) to access the platform.
    - Lawyers must connect their wallet for KYC verification and platform approval.
    - Platform access and dashboard functionalities are restricted unless a wallet is connected.
    - The wallet address serves as the user’s sole identifier (no traditional logins).

### 2.9 Escrow Account
A smart contract-based holding system that:
    - Temporarily holds user payments until consultation completion.
    - Releases funds automatically based on chatbox-triggered milestones.
    - Enables partial or full refunds in cases of valid disputes.
    - Cannot be manipulated manually—all fund transfers occur autonomously via smart contracts.

## 3. Scope of the Agreement
This Agreement applies to all disputes directly related to the use of the LawLinkGlobal platform. It governs issues arising from the scheduling, payment, and execution of legal consultations facilitated by the platform’s smart contract system. The purpose of this Agreement is to establish a clear resolution process for disputes arising from the technical and operational aspects of the platform.

A dispute under this Agreement refers to conflicts concerning consultation scheduling, cancellations, rescheduling, payment processing via escrow, technical failures, or platform-related misconduct by either party. Any issue related to the technical execution of transactions on the Sui Network, such as failed escrow releases, disputed refund claims, or system malfunctions affecting scheduled consultations, falls within the scope of this Agreement.

Disputes regarding the accuracy, content, or relevance of legal advice are explicitly excluded. LawLinkGlobal does not assess, validate, or intervene in the substance of consultations provided by lawyers. The platform is designed solely to facilitate and secure transactions and interactions. Any disagreement regarding the quality of legal advice must be resolved directly between the user and the lawyer outside the platform’s dispute resolution framework.

LawLinkGlobal functions as a decentralized, non-custodial service provider. It does not act as a mediator, arbitrator, or legal authority in disputes between users and lawyers beyond platform-related issues. Its role is limited to ensuring that transactions and engagements occur in accordance with the established blockchain-based protocols.

---

## 4. Initial Complaint Mechanism
A dispute may be initiated by either a user or a lawyer through the platform’s integrated Problem Statement Button, which is available within the chatbox interface. Activating this feature immediately triggers an automated hold on the escrowed funds, preventing their release until the dispute is assessed. The complaint must be lodged during or immediately after the consultation session, as disputes raised beyond the dispute window may not qualify for platform intervention.

Once a dispute is reported, the platform’s automated dispute resolution protocol is activated. The system analyzes transaction data, smart contract records, and session metadata to determine the validity of the claim. If necessary, the administrative team will conduct an independent review to assess whether the complaint falls within the platform’s dispute resolution parameters.

Timeliness is crucial. Complaints should be raised in real-time or within a maximum of 48 hours after the scheduled session to ensure that relevant data remains accessible. Given that LawLinkGlobal does not store chat records, disputes must rely on smart contract triggers, wallet-based transaction logs, and session activity timestamps for evaluation.

Users and lawyers involved in a dispute must provide any necessary evidence requested by the system or administrators. Failure to cooperate with the dispute resolution process may result in a default decision against the non-cooperative party. The initial response time for complaints is set at 48 hours, during which an initial determination will be made regarding the validity of the dispute and the next steps in resolution.

## 5. Role of LawLinkGlobal in Dispute Resolution
LawLinkGlobal acts strictly as a facilitator within the dispute resolution process. It does not function as a mediator, arbitrator, or legal authority, nor does it intervene in the legal aspects of consultations. The platform’s role is to ensure that all technical, transactional, and procedural aspects of disputes are handled fairly and efficiently using smart contract mechanisms and wallet-based authentication.

When a dispute is raised, LawLinkGlobal serves as the initial point of contact by gathering transaction data and assessing whether the issue falls within the platform’s scope. The platform remains neutral and impartial, ensuring that neither party receives preferential treatment. Its primary function is to execute automated resolutions, including escrow holds, fund releases, and refund processing, based on predefined blockchain logic.

Since LawLinkGlobal is a decentralized, non-custodial service, it does not have discretionary control over payments or consultation content. Once a consultation is completed and no valid dispute is raised within the designated timeframe, escrowed funds are automatically transferred to the lawyer’s wallet as per the smart contract logic. If a dispute is triggered, fund movements are paused until a resolution is reached.

LawLinkGlobal may recommend solutions to disputes based on transaction history and session data but does not enforce any legal obligations between users and lawyers. Its intervention is strictly limited to enforcing the rules and procedures set forth in the platform’s smart contracts. Any party seeking legal remedies outside the platform’s resolution framework must pursue them independently, without involving LawLinkGlobal in legal proceedings.

---

## 6. Dispute Evaluation Process

Upon receiving a dispute notification, the LawLinkGlobal dispute resolution protocol is initiated. This involves an initial automated assessment, followed by an optional manual review if required. The system evaluates relevant blockchain data, including escrow status, payment logs, session metadata, and smart contract triggers. If additional input is necessary, LawLinkGlobal’s support team may request clarifications or evidence from both parties.

The timeline for dispute evaluation follows a structured approach. Within 48 hours, an initial determination is made regarding the legitimacy of the dispute. If the complaint meets the validity criteria, further analysis is conducted, typically concluding within 72 hours. Resolution options may include fund release, partial or full refunds, or session rescheduling recommendations.

For a dispute to qualify for review, it must meet specific conditions: it must originate from a session facilitated through LawLinkGlobal, be reported within the designated timeframe, and include sufficient evidence supporting the claim. General dissatisfaction with legal advice does not constitute a valid dispute under this Agreement.

Once the investigation is completed, LawLinkGlobal proposes a recommended resolution, which may include a refund, escrow release, or other corrective action. These recommendations are based on objective criteria rather than subjective opinions. If a party disagrees with the outcome, they may seek external legal remedies independently.

LawLinkGlobal continuously refines its dispute resolution process through feedback and platform updates. The goal is to ensure that disputes are handled efficiently, transparently, and in accordance with the decentralized principles of the platform.

---

## 7. Potential Outcomes
Once a dispute is evaluated, LawLinkGlobal determines the appropriate resolution based on the findings. Since the platform operates on automated escrow transactions, outcomes are executed through predefined smart contract mechanisms to ensure transparency and fairness.

In cases where the dispute is ruled in favor of the user, the escrowed funds may be partially or fully refunded, depending on the nature of the issue. A full refund is granted if the consultation never took place due to the lawyer’s absence, or if the lawyer violated platform rules in a way that renders the session invalid. A partial refund may be issued if the session occurred but did not meet platform standards due to technical failures, misconduct, or other irregularities.

If the dispute does not warrant a refund, the escrowed payment is automatically released to the lawyer in accordance with the original smart contract terms. Once the escrow is finalized, the transaction becomes irreversible, consistent with blockchain immutability principles.

Lawyers who fail to comply with platform policies may receive formal warnings, and repeated infractions could lead to temporary suspension or permanent removal. Serious violations, including document falsification, non-attendance without valid reason, or attempts to bypass escrow payments, may result in immediate account termination.

To maintain platform integrity, LawLinkGlobal does not support session rescheduling as a form of dispute resolution. If a consultation is disrupted, affected parties are encouraged to initiate a new session rather than modifying the original appointment.

Throughout the dispute resolution process, both parties are encouraged to provide feedback. LawLinkGlobal continually refines its dispute-handling procedures to enhance platform security, efficiency, and fairness.

## 8. Lawyer Penalties and Repercussions
Lawyers registered on LawLinkGlobal are expected to uphold professional conduct, punctuality, and compliance with platform rules. Any deviation from these expectations may result in penalties, warnings, or account suspension.

Failure to attend a scheduled consultation without prior notice constitutes a serious breach of platform policies. A first-time violation results in a formal warning, while repeated absences may lead to temporary suspension. If non-attendance becomes a recurring issue, the lawyer's account may be permanently blacklisted from the platform.

Providing irrelevant or misleading answers during a consultation undermines the platform’s credibility. Lawyers engaging in such behavior receive progressive warnings, and repeated offenses may result in restricted access to user requests or complete removal from the platform.

Submitting false documents or misrepresenting professional credentials leads to immediate suspension pending an investigation. If fraud is confirmed, the lawyer is permanently banned, and LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to report the incident to relevant legal authorities.

Any attempt to bypass the escrow system by soliciting off-platform payments, manipulating wallet transactions, or encouraging users to transfer funds outside of the designated smart contract structure is strictly prohibited. Violators face immediate termination of platform privileges.

LawLinkGlobal continuously monitors lawyer activity to maintain high service quality. Any lawyer involved in a dispute resolution process may be subject to additional scrutiny to prevent future issues. Persistent violations result in permanent removal from the whitelisted lawyer registry, preventing further participation in platform services.

## 9. Obligations of the Lawyer

Lawyers registered on the LawLinkGlobal platform are expected to uphold high professional and ethical standards. By participating in the platform, they acknowledge and agree to the following responsibilities.

A lawyer must ensure punctuality and availability for all scheduled consultations. If a lawyer cannot attend a session due to unforeseen circumstances, they must inform the platform at the earliest opportunity to avoid penalties. Repeated failures to attend without valid reasons result in warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent removal from the platform.

Legal advice provided through LawLinkGlobal must be relevant, professional, and within the lawyer’s area of expertise. Offering misleading, incomplete, or off-topic guidance is considered a breach of platform policies. Lawyers who fail to maintain consultation standards may receive warnings, undergo additional scrutiny, or face removal from the platform.

The confidentiality of user interactions must be strictly maintained. Lawyers are prohibited from sharing user information, consultation details, or session content with third parties. Any breach of confidentiality may lead to permanent disqualification from the platform and potential legal consequences.

Lawyers are responsible for complying with all regulations governing their legal practice in their respective jurisdictions. They must ensure that they hold valid professional licenses and that their participation in online consultations adheres to local laws and bar association rules. Misrepresentation of credentials, submission of false documentation, or unauthorized practice of law results in immediate removal and possible legal reporting.

The use of off-platform payment methods is strictly forbidden. All transactions must occur through the platform’s smart contract-based escrow system. Any attempt to circumvent this mechanism, including soliciting direct payments from users, is considered a violation of platform policies and may lead to immediate suspension or permanent account termination.

## 10. Obligations of the User
Users engaging with LawLinkGlobal must act in good faith and adhere to the platform’s procedural guidelines. By accessing legal consultations, they accept and agree to the following responsibilities.


A user must accurately describe their legal issue and provide clear and truthful information during consultations. Any deliberate misrepresentation of facts, attempts to deceive lawyers, or submission of false claims undermines the platform’s integrity and may result in account suspension or permanent banning.Respect for lawyers and the consultation process is fundamental. Users must communicate professionally and constructively at all times. Abusive, harassing, or inappropriate behavior toward lawyers, including defamatory remarks or baseless accusations, is not tolerated. Violations may lead to temporary restrictions or removal from the platform.

The Problem Statement Button should only be used for legitimate dispute cases. Raising false complaints or abusing the dispute resolution mechanism to unjustly claim refunds is a serious offense. Users found misusing this system may face loss of dispute privileges, account restrictions, or suspension.

Users must adhere to the platform’s payment and escrow policies. Payments for consultations are automatically held in escrow and are released based on smart contract conditions. Any attempt to negotiate direct payments outside of the platform, cancel transactions after receiving legal advice, or exploit the escrow system is strictly prohibited and may result in a permanent ban.

Consultations on LawLinkGlobal provide legal guidance but do not replace formal legal representation. Users remain responsible for their legal decisions and actions. LawLinkGlobal does not guarantee case outcomes, and users should seek additional counsel if needed before proceeding with legal actions.

---

## 11. External Dispute Resolution
Disputes arising within the LawLinkGlobal platform are primarily resolved through the platform’s internal dispute resolution system, which operates via smart contract mechanisms and administrative review. However, in certain cases, users and lawyers may choose to seek external legal remedies beyond the platform’s scope.

Any legal actions or proceedings initiated due to legal advice received on the platform must be pursued independently. LawLinkGlobal does not participate in, mediate, or provide legal assistance in such disputes. The platform merely facilitates lawyer-user interactions and holds no liability regarding the content or quality of legal consultations.

Users and lawyers acknowledge that the platform does not act as an arbitrator or enforcer of legal outcomes. While it provides recommendations in dispute cases related to escrow payments and procedural issues, these recommendations are not legally binding beyond the scope of the platform.

Any disputes that require formal legal intervention shall be governed by the laws of Turkey. If a dispute escalates to litigation, all legal actions must be filed in the courts of Turkey, which shall have exclusive jurisdiction over matters related to the use of LawLinkGlobal. By using the platform, both users and lawyers expressly waive any objections to jurisdiction and venue in Turkish courts.

LawLinkGlobal is not responsible for legal claims arising from the misuse of information provided during consultations. Lawyers are individually responsible for ensuring compliance with their respective jurisdiction’s laws, and users are expected to exercise discretion when acting upon legal advice obtained through the platform.

The platform’s liability is strictly limited to the technical and procedural administration of transactions. Escrow-related disputes are finalized according to smart contract conditions, ensuring an objective and tamper-proof resolution process.

## 12. Modifications to the Agreement
LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to modify, update, or replace this Agreement at any time to reflect changes in platform functionality, blockchain infrastructure, or legal compliance requirements. Any such modifications shall take effect immediately upon being posted on the platform, unless otherwise specified.

It is the responsibility of all users and lawyers to periodically review this Agreement. Continued use of the platform following any modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised terms. If a user or lawyer does not agree with the updated terms, they should discontinue their use of the platform and contact LawLinkGlobal for clarification.

In the event of substantial changes that significantly impact dispute resolution procedures, LawLinkGlobal will make reasonable efforts to notify registered users and lawyers via email, platform notifications, or other communication channels. However, failure to receive direct notification does not exempt any party from complying with the modified terms.

LawLinkGlobal retains full authority to interpret and enforce this Agreement within the scope of the platform’s operations. Any ambiguities or disputes regarding the meaning of contractual terms shall be resolved in accordance with platform policies and applicable legal standards.
