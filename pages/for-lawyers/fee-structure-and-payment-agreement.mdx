## **1. Introduction**  

This Fee Structure and Payment Agreement (the “Agreement”) sets forth the financial terms and conditions under which verified lawyers (“Lawyers”) provide consultation services through the LawLinkGlobal platform (“Platform”). It defines the structure governing consultation fees, payment processes, escrow operations, dispute resolution mechanisms, and the overall financial interactions between Lawyers and Users. 

By establishing a transparent and decentralized financial system built on blockchain technology, this Agreement ensures that Lawyers receive fair compensation while maintaining the integrity of transactions and the efficiency of the platform’s financial processes. Through the use of smart contract-based escrow mechanisms, LawLinkGlobal eliminates payment risks, ensures automatic fund transfers, and provides a dispute resolution framework that balances the interests of all parties involved.

### **1.1 Scope of the Agreement**  

This Agreement applies exclusively to all verified Lawyers registered on the LawLinkGlobal platform who engage in consultation services with Users via the Chatbox or any future integrated services. By offering their services, Lawyers agree to the terms outlined herein and accept the regulatory and operational framework established by LawLinkGlobal. 

The Platform provides the technological infrastructure necessary for Lawyers to autonomously determine their consultation fees and receive payments securely through blockchain-based transactions. All payments are processed using an escrow-protected system, ensuring that funds are held securely until the consultation is completed or a dispute is resolved. By accepting payments through the Platform, Lawyers acknowledge that all financial transactions are governed by this Agreement and agree to its enforcement mechanisms.

### **1.2 Parties to the Agreement**  

This Agreement is entered into between LawLinkGlobal and the registered Lawyers providing legal services through the Platform. LawLinkGlobal, operated by **[Platform’s Legal Entity Name]**, is a blockchain-powered legal services network facilitating professional interactions between Lawyers and Users via smart contract technology on the Sui Network. 

Lawyers, as independent professionals, are responsible for setting their own consultation fees, adhering to jurisdictional legal standards, and ensuring compliance with the ethical and professional requirements applicable in their respective regions. By participating in the Platform, Lawyers acknowledge the decentralized nature of transactions, where payments are facilitated through blockchain-based mechanisms without traditional banking intermediaries.

### **1.3 Binding Nature of Smart Contracts**  

Financial transactions within LawLinkGlobal are executed exclusively through self-executing smart contracts on the Sui Network. This Agreement governs the escrow mechanisms, fund release conditions, refund scenarios, and any applicable deductions or transaction fees associated with these smart contracts. Lawyers understand and accept that once a transaction is initiated, its execution is governed by the programmed logic within the smart contract, leaving no room for external modifications unless a dispute is formally raised within the dispute resolution framework of the Platform.

By registering and operating on LawLinkGlobal, Lawyers expressly agree to be bound by the terms set forth in this Agreement, acknowledging that any modifications or future amendments will be communicated through the Platform and become enforceable upon continued use of its services.

## **2. Setting Consultation Fees**  

Lawyers providing legal consultation services through LawLinkGlobal have full autonomy in determining their own consultation fees. The Platform does not impose any minimum or maximum fee limitations, allowing Lawyers to set their rates based on their expertise, jurisdiction, market demand, and the value of their legal services. However, all fees must align with the applicable ethical and legal standards of the Lawyer’s jurisdiction.

The fee structure established by each Lawyer is publicly visible to Users before booking a consultation. By listing their rates on the Platform, Lawyers confirm that their fees are reasonable, transparent, and compliant with all applicable laws and professional conduct rules governing legal services in their respective regions.

### **2.1 Fee Adjustments and Market Considerations**  

Given that all transactions on LawLinkGlobal are conducted using cryptocurrency, Lawyers must remain informed about market fluctuations and currency exchange rates. The Platform provides real-time conversion tools that display the equivalent value of the Lawyer’s selected fee in **SUI**, along with its approximate value in **USDT** for reference. However, it remains the sole responsibility of the Lawyer to ensure that their consultation fees are adjusted periodically to reflect any significant changes in market conditions. 

Lawyers are strongly encouraged to review and update their fees at regular intervals. Failure to adjust fees in response to market fluctuations may result in discrepancies between expected and actual earnings. LawLinkGlobal bears no responsibility for losses arising from exchange rate volatility, nor does it intervene in the pricing strategies adopted by individual Lawyers.

### **2.2 Currency and Exchange Rate Transparency**  

All payments within the Platform are processed in **SUI**, the native cryptocurrency of the Sui Network. While the Platform provides an estimated equivalent in **USDT** for reference, this conversion serves an **informational purpose only** and does not alter the fundamental cryptocurrency-based nature of the transaction. 

Lawyers must acknowledge that cryptocurrency values are inherently volatile. Once a User books a consultation and completes the payment process, the fee amount is locked into an **escrow smart contract** at the exact exchange rate applicable at that moment. Any subsequent fluctuations in market value will not affect the locked amount. Refunds, if applicable, will be processed based on the original transaction amount rather than the value at the time of refund initiation.

### **2.3 No Platform Intervention in Fee Determination**  

LawLinkGlobal operates as a decentralized legal services platform and does not regulate, influence, or intervene in the fee-setting process of individual Lawyers. The Platform does not provide recommendations, guidelines, or minimum pricing requirements. The responsibility for establishing a competitive and ethically appropriate fee structure lies entirely with the Lawyer.

By listing their services on LawLinkGlobal, Lawyers affirm that their fees are fair and consistent with industry standards. In the event of any regulatory inquiries or disputes concerning excessive or unfair pricing, the Lawyer assumes full responsibility for defending their rates and demonstrating their compliance with applicable legal and professional norms.

### **2.4 Ethical and Legal Compliance in Pricing**  

Lawyers must ensure that their pricing practices align with the ethical obligations imposed by their respective **bar associations, legal licensing authorities, and professional regulatory bodies**. Fees should not be misleading, exploitative, or disproportionately high in relation to the service being provided.

The Platform reserves the right to review and take appropriate action in cases where a Lawyer’s fee structure raises ethical or legal concerns. If LawLinkGlobal determines, at its sole discretion, that a Lawyer’s fees are deceptive, misleading, or otherwise in violation of applicable professional conduct standards, the Platform may issue a warning, restrict visibility of the Lawyer’s profile, or suspend their account until compliance is ensured.

## **3. Payment Mechanics**  

All payments for legal consultations on LawLinkGlobal are facilitated through **smart contract-based escrow transactions on the Sui Network**. This mechanism ensures that funds are securely held and automatically released upon successful service completion, minimizing financial risks for both Lawyers and Users. By utilizing **decentralized, blockchain-powered payments**, LawLinkGlobal enhances transparency, security, and efficiency in financial transactions.

Lawyers acknowledge that all payments are processed exclusively in **SUI cryptocurrency**, and once a transaction is initiated, its execution is governed by smart contract logic, with **no manual intervention** from the Platform.

### **3.1 Escrow System and Fund Holding Mechanism**  

When a User books a consultation, the corresponding fee is **immediately locked in an escrow smart contract**, ensuring that funds are available and reserved for the service. The Lawyer does not receive the payment upfront; instead, the funds remain in escrow until the consultation is **successfully completed** or a **dispute resolution process is initiated**.

The escrow system operates as follows:  

1. **At the time of booking**, the User’s payment is transferred to an escrow smart contract.
2. **During the consultation**, the funds remain securely locked, ensuring that neither party can access them prematurely.
3. **Upon completion of the consultation**, the escrow smart contract automatically **releases the funds to the Lawyer** unless a dispute is raised.
4. **If a dispute is initiated**, the funds remain in escrow until the issue is reviewed and resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution framework.

### **3.2 Automatic Payment Disbursement to Lawyers**  

Once a consultation session is successfully concluded, and no disputes are raised, the smart contract **automatically releases the payment** to the Lawyer’s designated SUI wallet. This disbursement typically occurs **within one hour** of session completion, ensuring timely compensation for services rendered.

Lawyers are responsible for ensuring that their **SUI wallet addresses** are correctly registered on the Platform. LawLinkGlobal bears no responsibility for lost funds due to incorrect wallet information provided by the Lawyer.

### **3.3 Conditions That May Delay Payment Transfers**  

Certain conditions may cause a temporary hold or delay in the automatic transfer of funds from escrow to the Lawyer’s wallet, including but not limited to:  

- **User-initiated disputes:** If a User raises a complaint or requests a refund before the escrow release is executed, the transaction is **halted until resolution**.  
- **Technical malfunctions or network delays:** While blockchain transactions are generally instant, network congestion or temporary failures on the Sui Network may result in minor processing delays.  
- **Non-compliance with platform policies:** If LawLinkGlobal identifies irregularities in the Lawyer’s conduct or fee structure that warrant investigation, fund transfers may be temporarily suspended until the issue is resolved.  

In the event of a delayed transaction, the Platform will notify the Lawyer and provide updates on the status of the payment.

### **3.4 Transaction Fees and Associated Costs**  

All payments within the LawLinkGlobal ecosystem are subject to **blockchain transaction fees** (commonly referred to as **gas fees**) incurred during the execution of smart contracts on the Sui Network. These fees are automatically deducted from the transaction and vary based on network activity at the time of processing.

The following fees apply:  

- **Escrow deposit transaction fee:** Paid by the User when making the initial payment.  
- **Escrow release transaction fee:** Paid by the Lawyer when receiving funds from escrow.  

Lawyers acknowledge that these fees are inherent to blockchain transactions and agree to cover the costs associated with fund transfers. The Platform does not profit from transaction fees; these are dictated by the Sui Network’s underlying protocol.

### **3.5 Multi-Currency Conversion and Stable Value Display**  

To facilitate pricing transparency, the Platform provides an **estimated USDT equivalent** for all transactions. However, this value is for informational purposes only and does not impact the **SUI-based payment process**. The final transaction amount is locked at the time of booking and is **not subject to modifications based on currency fluctuations**.

Lawyers are responsible for considering potential **crypto market volatility** when setting their fees. LawLinkGlobal does not compensate for losses or gains resulting from exchange rate fluctuations.

### **3.6 Lawyer’s Responsibility for Wallet Security**  

Lawyers are solely responsible for the security of their **SUI wallets** and private keys. LawLinkGlobal does not store, manage, or recover private keys or lost wallet credentials. If a Lawyer loses access to their designated wallet, the Platform is **not liable for any lost payments**.

To prevent unauthorized access or theft, Lawyers are advised to:  

- Use a **secure and reputable SUI wallet** that supports LawLinkGlobal transactions.  
- Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** if available.  
- Regularly update their wallet software to ensure compatibility with the latest security protocols.  

By participating in the LawLinkGlobal ecosystem, Lawyers agree to abide by the payment mechanisms outlined in this Agreement and acknowledge the **finality of blockchain transactions** once executed.

## **4. Platform Fees & Deductions**  

LawLinkGlobal operates as a blockchain-powered legal services platform, providing Lawyers with access to a decentralized, secure, and efficient ecosystem for delivering legal consultations. In exchange for these services, the Platform applies certain fees and deductions, which are transparently disclosed and automatically deducted from payments processed through the escrow system.  

By using LawLinkGlobal, Lawyers acknowledge and agree that all fees and deductions outlined in this Agreement are **automatically enforced via smart contracts** and **are non-negotiable** unless expressly modified by the Platform with prior notice.

### **4.1 LawLinkGlobal Service Fee**  

Each consultation transaction processed through the Platform is subject to a **service fee**, which is automatically deducted from the Lawyer’s earnings before funds are released from escrow. This fee contributes to the ongoing maintenance, security, and operational costs of the Platform, including blockchain transaction processing, infrastructure management, and service enhancements.

The applicable service fee is calculated as a **percentage of the total consultation fee** set by the Lawyer. The exact percentage rate is specified in the LawLinkGlobal **Pricing Policy**, which is accessible through the Lawyer’s dashboard. The Platform reserves the right to modify this percentage with prior notice to all registered Lawyers.

Service fees are deducted **only when a transaction is successfully completed**. If a consultation is canceled, refunded, or disputed, the service fee will not be charged.

### **4.2 Blockchain Transaction Fees (Gas Fees)**  

All transactions conducted on LawLinkGlobal are processed via smart contracts deployed on the **Sui Network**, which requires the payment of **gas fees** to validate and execute blockchain transactions. These fees are not controlled by LawLinkGlobal but are determined by network activity and blockchain protocol conditions.

The following blockchain transaction fees apply:  

1. **Escrow deposit fee:** Paid by the User at the time of booking, covering the cost of locking the funds in escrow.  
2. **Escrow release fee:** Paid by the Lawyer when the payment is released from escrow to their SUI wallet.  

Blockchain transaction fees vary based on network congestion and usage demand. LawLinkGlobal provides estimated fee calculations before transaction execution, but actual costs may differ slightly due to real-time network fluctuations. Lawyers acknowledge that these fees are an inherent part of blockchain-based transactions and are **non-refundable**.

### **4.3 Currency Conversion Fees & USDT Price Display**  

While all payments on LawLinkGlobal are processed in **SUI**, the Platform provides a **USDT equivalent display** for reference. This estimated conversion rate is updated in real time based on prevailing market conditions. However, since payments are executed exclusively in cryptocurrency, the actual amount Lawyers receive will always be in **SUI**, and any fiat currency conversion must be handled independently.

LawLinkGlobal does not charge a separate fee for displaying estimated USDT values but does not guarantee conversion accuracy due to cryptocurrency volatility.

### **4.4 Refund & Dispute Resolution Deductions**  

In cases where a refund is processed due to a valid User complaint or a dispute resolution outcome, the following deductions may apply:  

- **Full Refund:** If a Lawyer fails to attend a scheduled consultation, provides misleading or incomplete legal guidance, or violates the Platform’s ethical policies, the full amount held in escrow will be returned to the User. In such cases, the Lawyer will not receive any compensation, and the Platform service fee will also be voided.  
- **Partial Refund:** If a dispute resolution process determines that a consultation was partially completed but did not fully meet the service standards, a **partial refund** may be issued, with the remaining amount released to the Lawyer. In such cases, the Platform service fee will be proportionally adjusted.  
- **Processing Fee Deduction:** Any refund processed incurs **a minimal blockchain transaction fee** to execute the return transaction. This cost is deducted from the total refund amount before returning funds to the User.  

All refunds are executed in **SUI** based on the **original transaction amount** at the time of booking, ensuring that Users receive the exact cryptocurrency amount they initially paid, regardless of market fluctuations.

### **4.5 Future Adjustments to Fee Structure**  

LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to modify the service fee structure, transaction fees, and refund policies based on operational requirements, technological advancements, or changes in blockchain network costs. Any modifications to the fee schedule will be communicated to Lawyers in advance through official Platform notifications.

By continuing to provide services on LawLinkGlobal after any fee adjustments take effect, Lawyers acknowledge and accept the revised terms.

## **5. Refunds & Dispute Resolution**  

LawLinkGlobal provides a **trust-based legal consultation ecosystem** where payments are processed via an **escrow smart contract system** to ensure that funds are safeguarded until services are rendered. However, in certain circumstances, a User may initiate a dispute or request a refund. This section outlines the conditions under which refunds may be issued, the dispute resolution process, and the rights and obligations of Lawyers in such cases.

By offering legal services through the Platform, Lawyers acknowledge that **refunds and dispute outcomes are enforced by smart contracts** in accordance with this Agreement. The final decision regarding refunds, where applicable, rests with **LawLinkGlobal’s dispute resolution mechanism**.

### **5.1 Situations Leading to Refunds**  

Refunds may be granted under the following circumstances:  

- **Non-Attendance by the Lawyer:** If a Lawyer fails to attend a scheduled consultation without prior cancellation or valid justification, the full amount held in escrow will be refunded to the User. The Lawyer will not receive any compensation for the missed session.  
- **Technical Failures Affecting Service Delivery:** If a **platform-related technical issue** (excluding issues caused by the Lawyer's own devices, internet connection, or software) prevents the consultation from being conducted properly, a refund may be issued.  
- **Incomplete or Inadequate Legal Service:** If a consultation is found to be **grossly inadequate**, lacking substance, or containing misleading information that does not reasonably address the User's legal concern, a **partial or full refund** may be granted following a dispute resolution process.  
- **User-Initiated Cancellations:** If a User cancels a consultation **before the scheduled time** and before the Lawyer has initiated any interaction, the escrowed amount may be refunded in full, with **no payment disbursed to the Lawyer**.  

Refunds are **not** granted for cases where the User is simply dissatisfied with the advice given unless the consultation is deemed to have been improperly conducted.

### **5.2 Escrow Hold Mechanism & Dispute Notification**  

To ensure fairness, all payments are **held in escrow** until the consultation is marked as **successfully completed** or **a dispute is raised**. If no dispute is raised, the smart contract **automatically releases the funds to the Lawyer’s wallet**.

If a User believes that the consultation was unsatisfactory and wishes to dispute the payment, they may initiate a **dispute resolution request** by using the designated dispute feature within the **chatbox support system** before the escrow release is executed.

Once a dispute is initiated:  

1. The **escrow release is temporarily halted**, preventing the automatic transfer of funds to the Lawyer’s wallet.  
2. LawLinkGlobal’s **dispute resolution team** is notified and reviews the circumstances surrounding the dispute.  
3. If necessary, the Platform may request additional information from both the User and the Lawyer before making a decision.  
4. The final decision will determine whether:  
   - The funds are fully released to the Lawyer,  
   - A **partial refund** is issued, or  
   - A **full refund** is granted to the User.  

Disputes must be raised **within 24 hours** after the consultation session ends. If no dispute is initiated within this period, the escrowed amount will be **automatically released** to the Lawyer, and no further refund claims will be entertained.

### **5.3 Criteria for Evaluating Disputes**  

LawLinkGlobal evaluates disputes based on the following criteria:  

- **Chatbox Interaction Logs:** While the Platform does not store chat transcripts, **event timestamps** (e.g., consultation start and end times, messages sent, and system-generated checkpoints) may be reviewed.  
- **Lawyer’s Compliance with Platform Guidelines:** If the Lawyer was found to have **violated professional ethics, failed to address the User’s concern, or engaged in misleading conduct**, the dispute may result in a **partial or full refund**.  
- **Technical Factors:** If the dispute arises from **technical failures** beyond the Lawyer’s control (e.g., blockchain network congestion, temporary service disruptions), the Platform will determine the most appropriate resolution.  

The dispute resolution process aims to be **swift and impartial**, ensuring that both Users and Lawyers receive a fair and justified outcome.

### **5.4 Cryptocurrency Volatility & Refund Processing**  

Given the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies, all refunds are processed based on **the original transaction amount** in **SUI**, rather than its market value at the time of refund issuance. This ensures that Users receive the **exact cryptocurrency amount they initially paid**, preventing potential manipulation or disputes over exchange rate fluctuations.

Lawyers acknowledge that the Platform **does not compensate** for any gains or losses resulting from market volatility, as all transactions are executed at the rate applicable at the time of booking.

### **5.5 Lawyer’s Obligations During a Dispute**  

If a dispute is raised concerning a consultation, the Lawyer is required to:  

- **Cooperate fully** with the Platform’s dispute resolution team by providing any requested information in a timely manner.  
- **Refrain from engaging in external negotiations** with the User outside the Platform’s official dispute resolution process.  
- **Respect the final decision** made by LawLinkGlobal, as all dispute outcomes are binding under this Agreement.  

Failure to comply with these obligations may result in **temporary account suspension** or, in severe cases, **permanent removal from the Platform**.

### **5.6 Finality of Dispute Resolution Decisions**  

The dispute resolution decisions made by LawLinkGlobal are **final and binding** on both parties. By participating in the Platform, Lawyers **waive any right to challenge or appeal refund decisions in external legal forums**, unless otherwise required by the governing law.

LawLinkGlobal retains full authority to modify, improve, or expand its dispute resolution framework as needed to ensure continued fairness, transparency, and efficiency in handling financial disputes.

## **6. Attendance & Professionalism**  

LawLinkGlobal is committed to maintaining a **high standard of professional integrity and service quality** across all interactions between Lawyers and Users. As part of this commitment, Lawyers are required to **honor scheduled appointments, provide competent legal advice, and maintain professional decorum** at all times. The Platform operates on a **zero-tolerance policy** regarding repeated non-attendance, unprofessional behavior, and ethical misconduct.

By providing legal consultation services through LawLinkGlobal, Lawyers acknowledge and agree to the following **attendance and professionalism requirements**, which are strictly enforced to protect Users and uphold the Platform’s reputation.

### **6.1 Duty to Attend Scheduled Consultations**  

Once a Lawyer confirms availability and a User books a consultation, the Lawyer is obligated to **attend the session at the scheduled time**. Non-attendance disrupts the trust-based relationship between Lawyers and Users and negatively impacts the credibility of the Platform.

Lawyers must ensure they:  

- Are **available and prepared** for the scheduled consultation at the agreed time.  
- Have **a stable internet connection and a functioning device** to facilitate the consultation.  
- Join the session **on time** and **do not leave prematurely** without just cause.  

If a Lawyer foresees that they will be unable to attend a scheduled session due to unforeseen circumstances, they **must cancel the booking in advance** through the Platform. Failure to do so may result in penalties as outlined in Section **6.3**.

### **6.2 Consultation Quality and Professional Conduct**  

Lawyers providing services on LawLinkGlobal must adhere to the highest standards of professional conduct. Every consultation should be conducted with:  

- **Competence and diligence** in addressing the User’s legal concerns.  
- **Respectful and professional communication** at all times.  
- **Clear and accurate legal guidance**, free from misleading or unethical advice.  

Lawyers must **not engage in any of the following prohibited behaviors**:  

- Providing **generic, non-substantive, or irrelevant responses** that do not address the User’s issue.  
- Using the Platform to **solicit Users for off-platform payments or engagements**.  
- Abusing, harassing, or behaving inappropriately toward Users.  
- Offering legal advice **outside their jurisdiction** or competence area, unless they are **explicitly licensed** to do so.  

Violations of these professional conduct standards may result in **temporary suspension, financial penalties, or permanent account termination**.

### **6.3 Consequences of Non-Attendance (No-Shows)**  

LawLinkGlobal enforces a strict **attendance policy** to ensure reliability and trust within its ecosystem. If a Lawyer **fails to attend a scheduled consultation without prior cancellation**, the following consequences apply:  

- **First No-Show:** The Lawyer will receive a **formal warning** and a notification regarding the missed appointment.  
- **Second No-Show:** A **monetary penalty** may be applied, and the Lawyer’s profile visibility may be affected.  
- **Third No-Show:** The Lawyer’s account may be **temporarily suspended**, and escrowed funds for future bookings may be withheld.  
- **Repeated Violations:** Consistent failure to attend scheduled consultations may result in **permanent removal** from the Platform.  

If a Lawyer accumulates multiple **unjustified no-shows**, the Platform reserves the right to **withhold earnings from pending consultations** as a penalty. The severity of enforcement depends on the frequency and nature of the violations.

### **6.4 Punctuality and Late Arrivals**  

While occasional delays due to unforeseen circumstances may occur, Lawyers must make **every reasonable effort** to start their consultations **on time**. If a Lawyer joins late, the following policies apply:  

- If a Lawyer is late by **more than 10 minutes**, the User has the right to request **a full refund**.  
- If the consultation **still takes place despite the delay**, but the Lawyer was **unreasonably late**, the User may request **a partial refund**, subject to Platform evaluation.  
- If a Lawyer is consistently late to multiple sessions, the Platform may apply **penalties or suspension measures** similar to those for **no-shows**.  

### **6.5 Impact on Ratings and Reputation**  

Lawyers’ attendance, punctuality, and consultation quality **directly affect their reputation** on LawLinkGlobal. The Platform employs a **rating and review system**, allowing Users to evaluate the professionalism of Lawyers. **Frequent absences, late arrivals, or substandard service** may result in:  

- **Lower visibility** in search rankings.  
- **Negative ratings and reviews**, which impact credibility.  
- **Reduced consultation bookings** due to loss of trust from potential Users.  

To maintain a strong professional reputation and maximize earnings, Lawyers must ensure **high service quality, punctuality, and professional integrity**.

### **6.6 Suspension and Removal for Unprofessional Conduct**  

LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to **temporarily suspend or permanently ban** a Lawyer’s account if they engage in **unprofessional or unethical conduct**. This includes but is not limited to:  

- **Repeated failure to attend consultations** without justification.  
- **Providing misleading, unethical, or incompetent legal advice**.  
- **Engaging in fraudulent activities, including fee manipulation or off-platform solicitation**.  
- **Harassment, abuse, or any form of unprofessional behavior toward Users**.  

The Platform’s disciplinary actions are **non-negotiable**, and reinstatement after suspension is at LawLinkGlobal’s sole discretion.

## **7. Confidentiality & Ethical Considerations**  

Lawyers providing legal consultation services on LawLinkGlobal are bound by strict professional and ethical obligations, including the duty of confidentiality and adherence to the highest standards of legal integrity. By offering services through the Platform, Lawyers affirm their commitment to maintaining client confidentiality, upholding professional conduct, and ensuring compliance with jurisdictional laws governing legal practice.

### **7.1 Duty of Confidentiality**  

All communications between Lawyers and Users within the Platform are considered confidential. Lawyers are strictly prohibited from disclosing, sharing, or using any information obtained during a consultation for any purpose other than providing the agreed legal service. Information provided by a User must not be stored, recorded, or transmitted outside the Platform unless required by law or explicitly authorized by the User in writing. 

To reinforce privacy, LawLinkGlobal does not retain chat transcripts or session content. However, session timestamps and transaction logs may be maintained strictly for compliance and dispute resolution purposes. Lawyers must take all reasonable precautions to protect User information and prevent unauthorized disclosure.

### **7.2 Compliance with Jurisdictional Regulations**  

Lawyers must comply with all professional and legal obligations applicable in their jurisdiction, including the rules established by their respective bar associations and licensing authorities. They bear full responsibility for ensuring that the legal services provided through LawLinkGlobal do not violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which they practice or where the User is located. 

Lawyers must not offer legal advice in regions where they are not licensed or authorized to practice unless such advice is general in nature and does not constitute unauthorized legal representation. LawLinkGlobal does not verify jurisdictional licensing, and any liability for unauthorized practice rests solely with the Lawyer.

### **7.3 Professional Conduct and Ethical Responsibilities**  

Lawyers must act with honesty, diligence, and professionalism in all interactions with Users. Legal advice provided must be competent, accurate, and aligned with the applicable laws governing the User’s inquiry. Any form of misrepresentation, exaggeration, or misleading guidance is strictly prohibited.

Conflicts of interest must be avoided. If a Lawyer recognizes a conflict that may impair their ability to provide objective legal advice, they must immediately disclose this to the User and refrain from proceeding with the consultation. Lawyers must also refrain from soliciting additional services from Users in a manner that is coercive, deceptive, or outside the scope of the initial consultation.

Engagements must be conducted strictly within the Platform’s ecosystem. Any attempt to bypass the Platform’s payment and escrow system, whether by directing Users to external payment methods or arranging off-platform consultations, constitutes a breach of this Agreement and may result in account suspension or permanent removal.

### **7.4 Handling of Sensitive Information**  

Given the decentralized nature of LawLinkGlobal, Lawyers must exercise caution when handling highly sensitive or privileged legal matters. They should advise Users to avoid sharing personal identifiers, financial account details, or other highly confidential information unless such disclosure is necessary for the consultation. Where applicable, external legal documents should be transmitted through encrypted channels to ensure data security.

Any suspected breach of data security, unauthorized access, or misuse of confidential information must be reported to LawLinkGlobal immediately. The Platform reserves the right to take necessary actions, including suspending or restricting access to the affected Lawyer’s account, to prevent further risk.

### **7.5 Consequences of Ethical Violations**  

Failure to comply with confidentiality obligations, ethical responsibilities, or jurisdictional regulations may result in disciplinary action. Depending on the severity of the violation, LawLinkGlobal may impose penalties including temporary suspension, permanent removal from the Platform, or reporting of the violation to the relevant legal or regulatory authorities. If a Lawyer’s misconduct results in financial loss or reputational harm to a User or the Platform, additional measures, including withholding payments held in escrow, may be enforced.

Lawyers acknowledge that they are solely responsible for adhering to the ethical and professional standards governing their legal practice. LawLinkGlobal assumes no liability for violations committed by individual Lawyers and reserves the right to amend its enforcement policies as necessary to maintain the integrity of the Platform.

### **8.3 Review and Acceptance of Amendments**  

Lawyers are responsible for periodically reviewing this Agreement to remain informed of any changes.

### **9.3 Limitations of Support Services**  

While LawLinkGlobal provides assistance with technical and payment-related concerns, support services **do not** include:  

- **Legal consultations or advice** related to the Lawyer’s jurisdiction, professional obligations, or case-specific matters.  
- **Intervention in disputes between Lawyers and external parties** outside of Platform-related transactions.  
- **Recovery of lost funds or private keys**, as LawLinkGlobal does not store or manage Lawyers’ cryptocurrency wallets.  

Lawyers are responsible for ensuring that they maintain control over their wallet credentials, comply with platform policies, and proactively manage their account settings to prevent avoidable issues.

## **10. Termination & Account Closure**  

This Agreement shall remain in effect for as long as the Lawyer maintains an active account on LawLinkGlobal. However, LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to **terminate or suspend a Lawyer’s account** under certain conditions, including but not limited to **violations of platform policies, unethical conduct, or fraudulent activities**. Lawyers may also choose to voluntarily close their accounts, subject to the provisions outlined in this section.

### **10.1 Grounds for Termination**  

A Lawyer’s account may be **suspended or permanently terminated** at LawLinkGlobal’s sole discretion if any of the following conditions apply:  

- **Breach of Agreement**: Violation of any material term in this Agreement, including but not limited to **payment policies, attendance obligations, and confidentiality requirements**.  
- **Fraudulent Activities**: Any attempt to manipulate transactions, engage in financial fraud, or misrepresent professional qualifications.  
- **Violation of Platform Rules**: Conduct that undermines the integrity, security, or reputation of LawLinkGlobal, including but not limited to **soliciting Users for off-platform engagements, providing misleading legal advice, or engaging in abusive behavior**.  
- **Legal or Ethical Violations**: Any action that constitutes professional misconduct, regulatory non-compliance, or unauthorized legal practice in any jurisdiction.  
- **Repeated User Complaints**: Excessive negative feedback or disputes indicating persistent service deficiencies, non-attendance, or professional incompetence.  

LawLinkGlobal reserves the right to initiate **immediate termination** in cases where a Lawyer’s actions **pose a significant risk to the Platform or its Users**.

### **10.2 Effects of Termination**  

Upon termination of a Lawyer’s account, the following conditions shall apply:  

- **Pending Payments & Escrow Settlements**: Any **earned but unpaid funds** held in escrow will be assessed and settled in accordance with the Platform’s **dispute resolution and payment policies** before final account closure. If a dispute is ongoing at the time of termination, the **resolution process must be completed** before any remaining payments are disbursed or refunded.  
- **Loss of Access to LawLinkGlobal Services**: A terminated Lawyer will immediately lose access to their **LawLinkGlobal dashboard, consultation booking system, and wallet-linked payment functionalities**. Any ongoing consultations will be canceled, and Users will be notified accordingly.  
- **Account Closure & Data Retention**: LawLinkGlobal will securely retain **only the minimum necessary transactional records** as required for compliance and regulatory obligations. However, the Lawyer’s profile, consultation history, and non-essential data will be permanently deleted from the Platform.  
- **Reinstatement Restrictions**: A Lawyer whose account has been terminated due to **fraud, professional misconduct, or repeated violations** may not re-register on the Platform under a different wallet or identity. Any attempt to circumvent this restriction may result in **legal action or reporting to relevant regulatory authorities**.  

### **10.3 Voluntary Account Closure by Lawyers**  

Lawyers may request the closure of their LawLinkGlobal account by submitting a formal request through the **support team**. Voluntary account closure shall be subject to the following conditions:  

- Any **pending transactions or escrowed payments must be fully settled** before account deactivation.  
- The Lawyer must **withdraw all available funds from their SUI wallet** linked to the Platform before the closure request is processed.  
- Once the account is closed, **access cannot be reinstated**, and a new registration would require **reverification of credentials**.  

### **10.4 Platform’s Right to Modify Termination Policies**  

LawLinkGlobal retains the authority to **adjust its termination policies** to align with regulatory requirements, cybersecurity risks, and operational needs. Any modifications will be communicated in accordance with Section **8 (Agreement Modifications)**.

By maintaining an active account on LawLinkGlobal, Lawyers acknowledge and accept the Platform’s right to enforce termination measures as outlined in this Agreement.
