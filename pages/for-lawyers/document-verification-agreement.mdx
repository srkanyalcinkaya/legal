## **1. Introduction**

This Document Verification Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between **LawLinkGlobal**, a blockchain-based legal services platform, and the **registered lawyer** ("Lawyer" or "Participant") seeking to provide professional legal services through the platform. By agreeing to these terms, the Lawyer acknowledges and accepts the verification requirements outlined herein, which serve as a fundamental prerequisite for their participation on the LawLinkGlobal platform.

### **1.1 Purpose of the Document Verification Process**  

LawLinkGlobal has established a comprehensive document verification process to ensure that only **qualified, licensed, and authenticated** legal professionals are permitted to offer their services. The verification process is designed to:  

- **Safeguard Platform Integrity:** By verifying professional credentials, LawLinkGlobal ensures that only legitimate and competent legal professionals provide services to users.  
- **Enhance User Trust:** Clients using the platform must be assured that they are consulting with **legally recognized attorneys**, thereby reducing the risks of misrepresentation or fraudulent claims.  
- **Adhere to Legal and Ethical Standards:** Lawyers are required to meet the minimum professional qualifications applicable within their jurisdiction and to comply with both the **LawLinkGlobal Code of Conduct** and the ethical guidelines set forth by their respective bar associations or governing legal bodies.  

This Agreement affirms that every lawyer on the platform has been subject to **rigorous verification**, ensuring compliance with the **highest professional standards**.

### **1.2 Mandatory Nature of Document Submission**  

The submission of valid and verifiable legal credentials is a **non-negotiable requirement** for lawyers registering on LawLinkGlobal. Participation on the platform is contingent upon **successful document verification**, and failure to comply will result in immediate denial of access to lawyer-specific services.  

Documents submitted as part of this process serve to:  

- Establish the **lawyer’s eligibility** to practice law.  
- Confirm that they meet the **minimum experience** and **jurisdictional licensing requirements**.  
- Provide an **encrypted record** of professional credentials, enhancing security and preventing unauthorized modifications.  

Failure to submit **accurate, valid, and truthful** information constitutes a breach of this Agreement and may result in **permanent exclusion** from the platform.  

### **1.3 Blockchain-Based Verification & Platform Security**  

LawLinkGlobal employs **blockchain-integrated verification** to ensure **tamper-proof validation** of lawyer credentials. The verification process utilizes **smart contracts** to:  

- **Encrypt and store document hashes**, ensuring that original copies are not retained beyond the verification stage.  
- **Whitelist verified lawyers** via a **secure admin wallet mechanism**, granting them access to lawyer-specific platform features.  
- **Automate authentication checks** for future verifications, reducing redundant document submissions while maintaining regulatory compliance.  

To enhance security and prevent unauthorized data storage, all documents submitted for verification will be **automatically deleted** from LawLinkGlobal's internal systems once the verification is complete. Only the cryptographic proof of verification will be maintained on the **Sui Network blockchain**, ensuring an immutable yet privacy-preserving verification record.  

### **1.4 Professional and Legal Consequences of Misrepresentation**  

Lawyers registering on LawLinkGlobal must recognize that **falsifying or misrepresenting credentials** is not only a **violation of this Agreement** but may also constitute:  

- **Professional misconduct**, resulting in disciplinary action from relevant **bar associations** or **governing legal authorities**.  
- **Legal fraud**, leading to civil or criminal liability under applicable laws in the lawyer’s jurisdiction.  
- **Permanent expulsion** from the LawLinkGlobal platform, including a **blockchain-registered blacklist**, preventing re-registration under any alias or modified credentials.

## **2. Requirements for Registration**  

To ensure the highest professional and ethical standards, every lawyer seeking to offer services on **LawLinkGlobal** must complete a rigorous verification process. This section outlines the necessary qualifications, documentation requirements, and mandatory authentication procedures that must be met before being granted access to the platform.  

### **2.1 General Requirements**  

All lawyers must provide verifiable proof of their **legal education, licensing, identity, and professional standing**. The submission of false or misleading information will result in immediate disqualification and potential legal consequences.  

Lawyers must hold a **recognized law degree** from an accredited institution. The document must clearly display the applicant's name, degree title, and date of issuance. In addition, a **valid license to practice law** is required, issued by the relevant bar association or governing legal authority in the applicant’s jurisdiction. This license must confirm that the lawyer is in good standing, authorized to represent clients, and compliant with all necessary regulatory obligations.  

Beyond educational and licensing credentials, lawyers are required to provide details of their **professional experience**, including areas of specialization and relevant casework. This ensures that prospective clients have access to comprehensive information about a lawyer’s expertise before engaging in consultations.  

To verify identity and prevent fraudulent representation, all applicants must submit a **government-issued identification document**, such as a passport, national ID card, or driver’s license. The details on this identification must match those on the professional credentials provided. Any discrepancies or inconsistencies in submitted information may result in delays or rejection of the application.  

Lastly, every lawyer must formally agree to **LawLinkGlobal’s ethical and professional standards**, which are designed to uphold trust, confidentiality, and compliance with jurisdictional legal frameworks. By completing the verification process, the lawyer acknowledges their duty to act with integrity, maintain client confidentiality, and adhere to all platform rules and regulations.  

### **2.2 Country-Specific Requirements**  

The practice of law is subject to varying regulations across jurisdictions. LawLinkGlobal ensures compliance with these diverse requirements by implementing country-specific registration criteria. In addition to the standard verification documents, lawyers may be required to submit **additional certifications, local bar memberships, or continuing legal education (CLE) records**, depending on the regulatory framework of their jurisdiction.  

Applicants are responsible for reviewing and fulfilling the specific requirements applicable to their country. Failure to provide the necessary jurisdictional documentation may lead to temporary or permanent restrictions on platform access.  

### **2.3 Blockchain-Based Wallet Integration & Authentication**  

As part of LawLinkGlobal’s **decentralized identity verification system**, all lawyers must connect a **Sui Wallet** during the registration process. This serves as the **primary authentication method**, ensuring that only verified lawyers have access to platform services.  

The wallet connection functions as both a **security measure** and a **financial gateway**, enabling secure transactions, escrow-based payments, and smart contract-driven interactions. Lawyers must use their wallet credentials to log in and access their professional dashboard. Once the verification process is completed, the **admin wallet will whitelist the lawyer’s address**, granting full platform access.  

To maintain security, lawyers are solely responsible for safeguarding their **wallet credentials and private keys**. LawLinkGlobal does not store, reset, or recover wallet data, and any loss of access may require a re-verification process.  

Failure to complete wallet integration will result in restricted access to platform features, as the authentication system is entirely **wallet-based**. Lawyers who do not connect a valid Sui Wallet will be unable to participate in consultations, receive payments, or manage their services on LawLinkGlobal.  

### **Registration Requirements**  

Only those who successfully meet the **educational, licensing, identity, and authentication criteria** outlined in this section will be permitted to offer legal services on LawLinkGlobal. Any attempt to **circumvent verification procedures or submit fraudulent documentation** will result in immediate disqualification and potential notification to the relevant legal authorities.  

Upon successful verification, the lawyer will gain full access to the platform and its associated services. However, ongoing compliance is required, and failure to maintain valid credentials or adhere to platform regulations may result in suspension or termination of services.

## **3. Submission of Documents**

   - If a document is incomplete or unreadable, the system will notify the user to rectify the issue before proceeding.  

4. **Final Submission & Confirmation Receipt**  
   - Once all documents are successfully uploaded, the system will generate a **confirmation receipt**, notifying the lawyer that their submission has been received and is under review.  
   - The lawyer will receive an **automated notification** confirming the submission via **email and the platform’s internal messaging system**.  

Failure to complete the submission process within the designated timeframe may result in delays or suspension of the registration process.  

### **3.2 Document Encryption & Security Measures**  

LawLinkGlobal employs **advanced encryption protocols** and **blockchain-based verification** to ensure that submitted documents remain secure, confidential, and tamper-proof. As part of the platform’s **privacy and security policy**, all documents undergo a strict encryption and automated deletion process.  

- **End-to-End Encryption:**  
  - Upon submission, documents are **encrypted immediately** using industry-standard encryption methods to prevent unauthorized access.  
  - Only designated platform administrators with **secured admin wallet credentials** can access these documents for verification purposes.  

- **Blockchain-Backed Verification & Auto-Deletion:**  
  - Instead of storing documents permanently, LawLinkGlobal **generates cryptographic hashes** of verified credentials and records them on the **Sui Network blockchain**.  
  - Once the verification process is complete, the original files are **automatically deleted** from the system, ensuring **no sensitive information is retained** beyond the necessary verification phase.  

- **Restricted Access:**  
  - No third parties, including other users, lawyers, or external entities, will have access to submitted documents unless required by legal authorities under applicable laws.  

These measures ensure that **document verification is secure, immutable, and privacy-focused**, reducing the risk of data breaches while maintaining the highest level of security compliance.  

### **3.3 Accepted Document Formats & Size Limitations**  

To maintain uniformity and prevent submission errors, LawLinkGlobal requires all documents to be uploaded in **standardized formats**. Documents that fail to meet these criteria may be rejected or require resubmission, delaying the verification process.  

- **Accepted file formats:**  
  - PDF  
  - JPEG  
  - PNG  

- **Maximum file size per document:**  
  - 8 MB  
  - If a document exceeds this limit, it must be compressed or submitted in multiple pages without compromising quality.  

Documents that are **blurred, illegible, or incomplete** will not be processed, and the lawyer will be required to resubmit them within the designated timeframe.  

### **3.4 Submission Deadline & Compliance**  

To ensure an efficient verification process, all lawyers must **submit their required documents within 14 days** from the date of initiating their registration.  

- Lawyers who fail to meet this deadline will have their registration process **temporarily suspended**, restricting access to legal services until the required documentation is provided.  
- If a lawyer anticipates delays due to **valid reasons**, they must **notify LawLinkGlobal’s support team** within the submission period to request an extension.  
- Automated **reminder notifications** will be sent before the deadline to ensure timely submission.  

Failure to submit the necessary documents within the given timeframe, without requesting an extension, may result in **permanent account ineligibility** until a new application is initiated.  

### **Document Submission Requirements**  

A **successful document submission** is a prerequisite for verification. Lawyers who **adhere to the encryption, format, and deadline requirements** will experience a **seamless approval process**, allowing them to proceed with verification and platform integration.  

Upon submission, LawLinkGlobal’s **dedicated verification team** will review the documents within the stated timeframe, after which the lawyer will be notified regarding their verification status. Any discrepancies or missing information may lead to requests for additional clarification, extending the verification period.

### **4.2 Smart Contract-Based Verification & Blockchain Authentication**  

Following the successful completion of the **initial review**, the platform integrates **blockchain verification mechanisms** to ensure that verified credentials remain **tamper-proof and immutable**.
