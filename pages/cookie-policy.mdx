## 1. Introduction

### **What are Cookies?**
Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device when you visit certain web pages. They are sent back and forth between the web server and the user's browser to ensure an efficient and interactive web browsing experience. For detailed information you can check www.aboutcookies.org or www.allaboutcookies.org. Here's a simple breakdown of their role and usage:

**Functionality:**
Cookies help websites remember your settings, preferences, and login statuses. This means you don't have to re-enter information or adjust your settings every time you revisit the site.

**Session Management:**
Some cookies, known as 'session cookies', last only for the duration of your web session and expire when you close your browser. They're essential for certain functionalities like keeping items in a shopping cart during a session.

**Tracking and Analytics:**
While some cookies help website owners understand user behavior by collecting data on how visitors use their site, these are not used on LawLinkGlobal due to our commitment to user privacy.

**Third-Party Integration:**
Some cookies are set by third-party services that appear on our pages, like payment gateways or embedded videos. They are set by these third parties and not directly by the website you're visiting.

On LawLinkGlobal, our use of cookies is strictly limited. We primarily use them to ensure the platform's functionality and to offer a seamless user experience. We don't use cookies for tracking, advertising, or data collection purposes, reaffirming our promise of prioritizing user privacy.

At LawLinkGlobal, we understand the importance of privacy and are committed to maintaining the trust of our users. We have adopted a minimalistic approach when it comes to the use of cookies on our platform. This Cookie Policy aims to provide clear and transparent information about the cookies we use and the reasons behind their use.
