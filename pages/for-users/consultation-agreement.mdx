Consultations are structured to address **specific legal concerns** raised by the User, allowing for an exchange of relevant legal knowledge and guidance.  

Each consultation is **personalized**, meaning that the advice given is based on the unique circumstances, documents, and information provided by the User.

### **3.3 Boundaries**  

To maintain **security, professionalism, and ethical integrity**, certain boundaries govern the scope of consultations:

## **4. Fees and Payments**  

### **4.1 Payment Process**  

Users engaging in consultations through **LawLinkGlobal** are required to complete **advance payment** for services via the platform’s integrated **Sui Network escrow system**. This ensures that funds are securely held until the consultation is successfully completed, providing financial protection for both **Users** and **Lawyers**.  

Each **Lawyer** independently determines their consultation fees, which are transparently displayed to **Users** before booking. By proceeding with a consultation, Users acknowledge and agree to the stated fee, which is **non-negotiable once the booking is confirmed**.  

To safeguard transactions, **escrow protection** is implemented through **smart contracts** on the Sui Network. When a User books a consultation, the payment is **locked in escrow**, preventing unauthorized withdrawals or modifications. Upon the successful completion of the session, the **escrow system automatically releases the funds to the Lawyer**.  

If a **consultation is disrupted** due to platform-related technical failures or falls under a valid refund policy, the **escrow system ensures that payments are either refunded or adjusted accordingly**, subject to the review process outlined in LawLinkGlobal’s Payment Agreement.

Cancellations made **within three (3) days** of the session are **non-refundable**. This policy compensates Lawyers for their reserved time and prevents last-minute disruptions.

If a Lawyer declines a last-minute rescheduling request, the session will proceed as originally scheduled or be subject to the cancellation policy.  

### **8.3 Cancellation by Lawyers**  

In the event that a Lawyer needs to cancel a scheduled consultation, the User will be **notified promptly** and given the choice to either **reschedule the session at a later time** or **receive a full refund**, including transaction fees. LawLinkGlobal expects Lawyers to honor their commitments and reserves the right to review repeated cancellations that may affect the User experience on the platform.
